# User Guide

This guide provides an overview of the main features and commands available in the Hamster Kombat Key Generator Telegram bot.

## Main Commands

- `/start`: Initial message with language selection.
- `/menu`: Main menu where users can generate keys.
- `/language`: Change the language of the bot.
- `/myid`: Retrieve your Telegram UserID.s
- `/broadcast`: Subscribe to the broadcast from the administrators

    > **Info:**
    Any setting in the admin panel works at the expense of finite state machines (FSM). They start working from the moment you select the type of setting and until they are completed. You can reset the configuration process by entering the command `/admin`

## Key Generation

Keys are generated through the main menu, accessible after selecting a language or via the `/menu` command. The generation process is straightforward and user-friendly.

## Key collection history

Using the **History** button in the menu called by the `/menu` command you can access the history of all keys received on the current day. This is useful if you accidentally deleted a key or just want to combine all the keys you received in one place.

## Updating daily limits

The daily limits are updated daily at 0:00 UTC. This update also clears the history of keys received over the past day.

The bot supports 18 languages, making it accessible to users globally. Language selection is handled via the `/start` or `/language` commands.
All available languages are listed in [introduction](introduction.md)
